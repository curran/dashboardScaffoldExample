An example project that uses the dashboardScaffold library.

A development server is included. To start the server:

 * Make sure you have Node.js and Express installed
   * `npm install express`
 * Run `node server.js`

There are two pages:

 * `index.html` shows the dashboard with an editor panel
 * `dashboard.html` shows the dashboard full-screen with no editor
